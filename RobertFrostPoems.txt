The house had gone to bring agaIn 
To the midnight sky a sunset glow. 
Now the chImney was all of the house that stood, 
Like a PIstIl after the petals go. 

The bam opposed across the way, 
That would have joined the house in flame 
Had it been the will of the wind, was left 
To bear forsaken the place's name.
 
No more it opened with all one end 
For teams that came by the stony road 
To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs 
And brush the mow with the summer load. 

The birds that came to it through the air 
At broken wmdows Hew out and in, 
Their murmur more like the SIgh we sigh 
From too much dwelling on what has been.
 
Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf, 
And the aged elm, though touched with fire; 
And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm; 
And the fence post carried a strand of wire. 

For them there was really nothing sad. 
But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept, 
One had to be versed in country things 
Not to believe the phoebes wept. 


These pools that, though In forest, stIll reflect 
The total sky almost wIthout defect, 
And hke the flowers beMde them, chIll and shIver, 
WIll hke the flowers beside them soon be gone,
And yet not out by any brook or rIVel, 
But up by roots to bnng dark fohage on
 
The trees that have It in theIr pent-up buds 
To darken nature and be summer woods-
Let them thInk twIce before they use then powers 
To blot out and drink up and sweep avvay 
These flowery waters and these watery flowers 
From snow that melted only yesterday. 


I've tried the new moon tilted In the air 
Above a hazy tree-and-farmhouse cluster 
As you might try a jewel In your han 
I've tried It fine WIth httle breadth of luster, 
Alone, or in one ornament combining 
With one first-water star almost as shining 

J put it shinmg anyvvhere I please 
By walkmg slowly on some evening later, 
I've pulled It from a crate of crooked trees, 
And brought it over glossy water, greater, 
And dropped it in, and seen the image wallow, 
The color run, all sorts of wonder follow.


The rose is a rose, 
And was always a rose. 
But the theory now goes 
That the apple's a rose, 
And the pear IS, and so's 
The plum, I suppose. 
The dear only knows 
What will next prove a rose. 
You, of course, are a rose
But were always a rose. 


Here come real stars to fill the upper skies, 
And hele on earth come emulating HIes, 
That though they never equal stars ill SIze, 
(And they were never really stars at heart) 
Achieve at hmes a very star-hke start. 
Only, of course, they can't sustain the part.


Winds blow the open grassy places bleak, 
But where tills old wall burns a sunny cheek, 
They eddy over It too topphng weak 
To blow the earth or anythIng self-clear, 
MOIsture and color and odor thIcken here. 
The hours of dayhght gather atmosphere.


The heart can think of no devotion 
Greater than being shore to the ocean
Holding the curve of one position, 
Counting an endless repetItion.


As vain to raIse a voice as a sIgh 
In the tumult of free leaves on hIgh 
What are you In the shadow of b'ees 
Engaged up there wIth the light and breeze ~ 

Less than the coral-root you know 
That IS content with the dayhght low, 
And has no leaves at all of ItS own, 
Whose spotted flowers hang meanly down. 

You grasp the bark by a rugged pleat, 
And look up small from the forest's feet. 
The only leaf it drops goes wide, 
Your name not wntten on eIther SIde. 

You hnger your little hour and are gone, 
And still the woods sweep leafily on, 
Not even missing the coral-root flower 


As far as I can see tlus autumn haze 
That spreadIng III the evenIng air both ways 
Makes the new moon look anythIng but new, 
And pours the elm-tree meadow full of blue, 
Is all the smoke from one poor house alone 
WIth but one chImney it can call Its own, 
So close It will not light an early light, 
Keepmg its life so close and out of sight 
No one for hours has set a foot outdoors 
So much as to take care of evenmg chores. 
The Inmates may be lonely women-folk 
I want to tell them that with all thIs smoke 
They prudently are spinnmg their cocoon 
And anchoring it to an earth and moon 
From wInch no winter gale can hope to blow it,
Spinmng their own cocoon did they but know it.

 
I often see flowers from a passIng car 
That are gone before I can tell what they are 

I want to get out of the traIn and go back 
To see what they were besIde the track 

I name all the flowers I am sure they weren't. 
Not fireweed lovIng where woods have bumt

Not bluebells gracing a tunnel mouth
Not lupIne liVIng on sand and drouth
 
Was something brushed across my mInd 
That no one on earth will ever find? 

Heaven gives its glimpses only to those 
Not In position to look too close. 


Dust always blowing about the town, 
Except when sea-fog laid It down, 
And I was one of the children told 
Some of the blOWIng dust was gold.
 
All the dust the wind blew high 
Appeared hke gold in the sunset sky, 
But I was one of the chIldren told 
Some of the dust was really gold. 

Such was hfe in the Golden Gate. 
Gold dusted all we drank and ate, 
And I VIlas one of the children told, 
'We all must eat our peck of gold.' 


When the spent sun thiOWS up its rays on cloud 
And goes down burning Into the gulf belo\v, 
No VOIce In nature is heard to cry aloud 
At what has happened. BIrds, at ~least, must know' 
It IS the change to darkness in the sky 
Murmunng somethIng qUIet In her breast, 
One bIrd begins to close a faded eye, -I 
Or overtaken too far from his nest, 
Hurrying low above the grove, some waif 
Swoops just in time to his remembered tree. 
At most he thinks or tWItters softly, 'Safe!' 
Now let the night be dark for all of me. 
Let the night be too dark for me to see 
Into the future. Let what WIll be, be,' 


The shattered water made a misty din. 
Great waves looked over others coming in, 
And thought of dOIng somethIng to the shore 
That water never did to land before. 
The clouds were low and hairy in the skIes, 
Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes. 
You could not tell, and yet it looked as if 
The shore was lucky in being backed by chff, 
The cliff In being backed by contment; 
It looked as if a nIght of dark intent 
Was coming, and not only a night, an age. 
Someone had better be prepared for rage. 
There would be more than ocean-water broken 
Before God's last Put out the Light was spoken. 


The raIn to the wInd saId, 
'You push and I'll pelt' 
They so smote the garden bed 
That the flowers actually knelt, 
And lay lodged-though not dead. 
I know how the flowers felt. 


I have wIshed a bird would flyaway, 
And not sIng by my house all day; 

Have clapped my hands at hIm from the door 
When It seemed as if I could bear no more.
 
The fault must partly have been in me. 
The bIrd was not to blame for his key. 

And of course there must be something wrong 
In wanting to silence any song. 


Where had I heard thIS wInd before 
Change like tIus to a deeper roal? 
What wou1d It take my standIng there for, 
Holding open a restive door, 
Loolnng down hIll to a frothy shore? 
Summer was past and day was past 
Somber clouds In the west were massed. 
Out ill the porch's sagging floor, 
Leaves got up in a coil and hIssed, 
Blindly struck at my knee and mIssed. 
Something sinister In the tone 
Told me my secret must be known: 
Word I was in the house alone 
Somehow must have gotten abroad, 
Word I was in my hfe alone, 
Word I had no one left but God. 


Tree at my wIndow, \vIndow bee, 
My sash is lowered when night comes on, 
But let there never be curtaIn drawn 
Between you and me 

Vague dream-head lifted out of the ground, 
And thing next most dIffuse to cloud, 
Not all your light tongues tallang aloud 
Could be profound. 

But, tree, I have seen you taken and tossed, 
And If you have seen me when I slept, 
You have seen me when I was taken and swept 
And all but lost 

That day she put our heads together, 
Fate had her imagmatlOn about her, 
Your head so much concerned with outer, 
Mine wIth inner, weather. 


If heaven were to do agaIn, 
And on the pasture bars, 
I leaned to hne the figures In 
Between the dotted stars, 

I should be tempted to forget, 
I fear, the Crown of Rule, 
The Scales of Trade, the Cross of FaIth, 
As hardly worth renewal. 

For these have governed TIl our hves, 
And see how men have warred 
The Cross, the Crown, the Scales may all 
As well have been the Sword. 


Out alone In the WIn tel rain, 
Intent on gIvIng and talang paIn. 
But never was I far out of sIght 
Of a certaIn upper-wIndow lIght. 
The hght was what it was all about. 
I would not go In tIll the hght went out, 
It would not go out tIll I came ill. 
Well, we should see whICh one would WIn, 
We should see whICh one would be first to YIeld 
The world was a black mvislble field. 
The raIn by rights was snow for cold. 
The WInd was another layer of mold 
But the strangest thing. in the thick old thatch, 
Where summer bIrds had been given hatch, 
Had fed In chorus, and lived to Hedge, 
Some stIll were liVIng in hermitage. 
And as I passed along the eaves, 
So low I brushed the straw WIth my sleeves, 
I Hushed birds out of hole after hole, 
Into the darkness. It grieved my soul, 
It started a grief WIthIn a grief, 
To think their case was beyond relief
They could not go flymg about ill search 
Of their nest again. nor find a perch. 
They must brood where they fell in mulch and mIre, 
Trusting feathers and inward fire 
Till daylight made It safe for a flyer. 
My greater grief was by so much reduced 
As I thought of them without nest or roost. 
That was how that grief started to melt. 
They tell me the cottage where we dwelt, 
Its wind-torn thatch goes now unmended; 
Its life of hundreds of years has ended 
By letting the rain I knew outdoors 
In on to the upper chamber floors. 


A winter garden in an alder swamp, 
Where conIes now come out to sun and romp, 
As near a paradIse as it can be 
And not melt snow or start a dormant tree. 

It lifts eXIstence on a plane of snow 
One levellugher than the earth below, 
One level nearer heaven overhead, 
And last year's berries shinmg scarlet red. 

It lifts a gaunt luxurIating beast 
Where he can stletch and hold hIS hIghest feast 
On some wild apple tree's young tender bark, 
What well may prove the year's high girdle mark. 

So near to paradise all pairing ends: 
Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends, 
Content with bud-inspecting. They presume 
To say which buds are leaf and whIch are bloom.
 
A feather-hammer gives a double knock 
This Eden day is done at two o'clock. 
An hour of winter day might seem too short 
To make it worth life's while to wake and sport.


Blood has been harder to dam back than water. 
Just when we think we have It Impounded safe 
Behind new barrIer walls (and let it chafe'), 
It breaks away in some new kind of slaughter. 
We choose to say It is let loose by the devil, 
But power of blood itself releases blood 
It goes by mIght of being such a Hood 
Held hIgh at so unnatural a level. 
It will have outlet, brave and not so brave. 
Weapons of war and implements of peace 
Are but the pomts at whICh it finds release. 
And now it is once more the tidal wave 
That when it has swept by leaves summits staIned. 
Oh, blood will out. It cannot be contained. 


I have been one acquainted with the night. 
I have walked out In raIn-and back in rain. 
I have outwalked the furthest city light 

I have looked down the saddest CIty lane. 
I have passed by the watchman on his beat 
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.
 
I have stood stIlI and stopped the sound of feet 
When far away an Interrupted cry 
Came over houses from another street, 

But not to call me back or say good-by; 
And further stIll at an unearthly height, 
One luminary clock against the sky 

ProclaImed the time was neither wrong nor right. 
I have been one acquainted with the night.
